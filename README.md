### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP

- Use Airtable to create and render API.
- Create home page with functional routes.
- Allow users to reply to questions from the home page.
- Allow users to create their own questions.
- Create a page with a list of guidelines.

#### PostMVP

- Create a page for a daily vote. This would require a second airtable api.
- Add additional styling.
- Create functionality for buttons/icons.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good understanding of APIs and how to efficiently render them. I also have a strong-suit in CSS. Finally, I do well with walking through my coding process. This gives me a better understanding for exactly what I am doing.

### Weaknesses:

One weakness is that I need to be more familiar with routes and links. I have a decent understanding with them, but I need more practice.

### Opportunities:

Creating this project will give me the opportunity to seriously test what I have learned during this unit. It will also challenge my creativity and patience.

### Threats:

I already know that a lot of errors will occur during this project, especially with the api. Although errors will come, I will be able to overcome them.
